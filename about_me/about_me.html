<h2>My Favorite trip</h2>
    <p class="p1">I recently visited Barcelona and was fascinated by its mix of history and modernity. I walked along Las Ramblas, where the atmosphere was lively and full of energy, with street performers, markets, and cafés everywhere.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the places that impressed me the most was the Sagrada Familia. Gaudí’s architecture is simply stunning. I spent a while admiring the details on the façade and then went inside to see the colorful stained glass lighting up the interior.</p>
<p class="p1">I also really enjoyed the food. I tried delicious tapas and had a paella by the sea in Barceloneta. The weather was perfect, so I spent the afternoon walking along the beach and watching the sunset.</p>

<h2>My Favorite pet names</h2>
<ul>
    <li> A dog named Waffles</li>
    <li> A cat named Luna Bean</li>
    <li> A parrot named Mango Tango</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
  <p>
    One of my favorite places to eat is <a href="https://boqueriarestaurant.com" target="_blank">Boqueria Restaurant</a> in Boston, MA.
    I love it because the dishes are creative and full of flavor, and the atmosphere is elegant yet welcoming.
  </p>

<h2>Paella – My Favorite Dish</h2>
  <img src="Paella.jpg" alt="Paella" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; width: 300px; border: 5px solid #FF4500;">
  <p style="text-align: justify; width: 800px; background-color: beige; font-size: 20px;">
    I absolutely love paella, especially when it's full of fresh seafood. I like to serve it hot with a slice of lemon on the side and enjoy it with friends or family. The mix of rice, saffron, and seafood flavors is just perfect. It's a dish that always reminds me of summer and celebration.
